Below is a three-dimensional map of the universe containing eight galaxies that
you, as the traveling spaceman, wish to visit. Each galaxy's position in the
universe is indicated by the accompanying table.

Galaxy	 x	y      z
a       26     38     30
b       75      6     55
c        3     46     66
d       73     59     75
e       37     72      7
f       42     83     67
g       21     77     91
h       80     18      4

Questions:
1. Starting (and ending) at galaxy 'a,' in what order should you visit each
galaxy to minimize the traveled distance? You must visit each galaxy and you
cannot visit any galaxy more than once.
2. What is the total distance traveled?
